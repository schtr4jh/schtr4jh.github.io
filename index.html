                <p><strong>As a freelancer, full-time employee, or outsourced co-worker I have worked on more than 500
                    web pages, stores, and other web applications since 2006.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>During this time Iâ€™ve learned a lot about frontend, backend, and web infrastructure. On the backend,
                    I have mostly used <strong>PHP</strong> on top of Laravel, Symfony, and Pckg frameworks. With
                    planning, designing end development of user interfaces with <strong>HTML</strong>,
                    <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JS,</strong> and other web technologies. I am working in a <strong>VueJS</strong>
                    ecosystem including VueRouter, VueX, Webpack, Yarn, and related tools.
                </p>
                <p>I am capable of installing, configuring, and managing <strong>MySQL</strong> in numerous modes,
                    <strong>HAProxy</strong> server for load-balancing, SSL-offloading, and more,
                    <strong>Apache</strong> for serving dynamic requests,<strong>NginX</strong> for serving static
                    files, <strong>RabbitMQ</strong> as a queue database and a message broker, <strong>Redis</strong>,
                    and <strong>Varnish</strong> for caching data on the backend and frontend. Whether they are deployed
                    on a bare-metal, cloud, or container infrastructure. I have experience with <strong>Docker
                        Swarm</strong> environment, SSL certificates, MySQL replication, email processes, and process
                    automation.
                </p>
                <p>Among other things I have also integrated multiple payment gateways or providers, have deep knowledge
                    of how networks and DNS work, know some things about hardware and software in Linux and Microsoft
                    environments. I have some experience with TDD and automated testing with Codeception, Selenium, and
                    PhantomJS, and usage of Circle CI, Bitbucket Pipelines, Github Runners, Travis, and Jenkins CI / CD
                    tools. I would definitely like to upgrade my knowledge in the mentioned fields.
                </p>
                <p>Despite the wide range of technologies mentioned above, Irarely used AWS, WordPress or Magento, and
                    almost never Shopify store or iOS. I am a quick learner, not having problems with learning about new
                    processes and technologies.

                    At my position at <strong>GNP d.o.o.</strong>, I played an important part in our small team. We have
                    developed an all-in-one solution for businesses to present themselves online using our
                    do-it-yourself page builder, manage their online store, and communicate with customers -

                    I was responsible for all the technology and infrastructure decisions and choices, planning,

                    and administration parts.

                <p>
                    With that written, my work usually also included standard tasks:<br/>- documentation and
                    automatization of other processes,<br/>- scaling, load-balancing, and replication of services for
                    high-availability and other purposes,<br/>- infrastructure management and supervision,<br/>- giving
                    support to local and worldwide clients,<br/>- mentorship and code review.

                    I have found my first full-time employment as a web developer at medium-sized web agency company
                    <strong>spletnaPOSTAJA d.o.o.</strong> where I have immediately taken over maintenance and
                    development of three larger online stores for an important foreign client. My work consisted out of
                    working on an existing Symfony 1.0 codebase, new module development based on project documentation,
                    implementation of payment providers, and other APIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later I have actively cooperated on backend and frontend development on many of other projects,
                    mostly websites, stores, and applications, as well as upgrading in-house CMS and CRM. The company
                    gave me a good view of the e-commerce industry in Slovenia and Europe. Some of my projects were
                    also awarded the Netko awards.

                <p>
                    I have also worked on:<br/>- maintenance and upgrades of new and existing modules,<br/>- usage and
                    upgrades of an in-house Booster CMS and CRM,<br/>- servers and services management,<br/>- customer
                    support,<br/>- management of a cpanel hosting and<br/>- maintenance of the internal infrastructure.

                    In the beginning, I have - besides learning about hardware and software â€“ worked on small tasks as
                    .psd to HTML and CSS design transformations, development of small websites, and making changes to
                    existing projects. At that time jQuery did not exist yet, layouts were made with the tables, and
                    servers were running on PHP v4.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have followed the technology, and soon started working on more complex projects, online stores,
                    and continued with internet co-creation. Among other things, I have made dozens of PHP packages and
                    standalone applications, all available on Github.
